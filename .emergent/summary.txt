The AI engineer successfully built a luxury static website for an Airbnb property with iGMS booking integration. Initially, after failing to crawl Airbnb, the AI built a site with placeholder content. The user rejected the first design, providing a reference Airbnb page for a complete redesign. The AI then meticulously recreated the requested design, including a split hero gallery with rounded images, a new font system, and a warm color palette. Subsequent iterations involved integrating user-provided photos, adding Show More functionality for descriptions and reviews, implementing a Things to Know section, and developing a custom backend for the contact form after Formspree limitations were identified. Significant effort was also put into responsive design, especially for the mobile header and a floating Check Availability button, which required debugging for reliable scrolling. The current task involves refining the reviews section from a newly provided Excel file, as a previous extraction was incomplete.

The user requires a luxury, upscale static website for an Airbnb property, inspired by a specific reference page (http://vancouverdirect.igms.com/property/bc-place-modern-1br-with-a-nice-balcony/). The site must feature a split layout hero section with access to an image gallery, an integrated iGMS direct booking widget (positioned near the top), a contact form, and a dedicated section for guest reviews. Key design elements to emulate from the reference include a light background, rounded corners on images, a clean sans-serif font, blue interactive elements, and white content cards. Specific sections like other properties should be omitted. Over time, the user provided property content, including 15 photos, detailed descriptions, a Google Maps API key, 14 guest reviews, and Things to Know content. The contact form needs to send emails to  and  with high priority, without exposing addresses. Mobile responsiveness is critical, requiring a fixed header without navigation links and a floating Check Availability button linking to the iGMS widget.

<pending_tasks>
- Ensure complete and accurate extraction of all 14 reviews from the  file.
- Update the  component in the frontend with the newly extracted, correct review data.
- Verify that Mishka's review is indeed the 14th and last in the list as specified.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on updating the Reviews section of the website. The user had provided an updated  file containing 14 reviews, with a specific request to ensure a particular review (Mishka's) was the 14th and last. The previous attempt by the AI to extract data from this file () was noted as incomplete, failing to get all the review text. The AI's current action is to re-examine the Excel file more carefully to ensure a complete and accurate extraction of all review details before attempting to update the  component again.

**File being analyzed/worked on (implicitly):** The  file (artifact from user) and the internal logic for parsing it, leading to a potential edit in .
