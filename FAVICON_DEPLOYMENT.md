# Favicon Deployment Guide for GitHub Pages

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

The Jade Key logo has been added as your site's favicon (the icon that appears in browser tabs and bookmarks).

### Files Updated:
1. `/app/frontend/public/logo.jpg` - Your logo saved locally
2. `/app/frontend/public/index.html` - Updated to reference the new favicon

## üöÄ How to Deploy the Favicon to GitHub Pages

### Step 1: Rebuild Your Site

From the `/frontend` directory, run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- Build your React app
- Copy all files from `public/` (including `logo.jpg`) to the `/docs` folder
- Create the `.nojekyll` file
- Your favicon will be included automatically

### Step 2: Verify the Files

Check that the logo was copied correctly:

```bash
ls -la /app/docs/logo.jpg
```

You should see the file exists in the docs folder.

### Step 3: Commit and Push to GitHub

```bash
cd /app
git add docs/
git add frontend/public/logo.jpg
git add frontend/public/index.html
git commit -m "Add Jade Key logo as favicon"
git push
```

Or use the **"Save to GitHub"** button in Emergent.

### Step 4: Wait for GitHub Pages to Rebuild

- GitHub Pages typically takes 1-3 minutes to rebuild
- Once deployed, the favicon will appear in your browser tab
- You may need to clear your browser cache or do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Favicon Not Showing Up?

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or clear cache in browser settings

2. **Check if File Exists on GitHub**
   - Visit: `https://[your-username].github.io/[repo-name]/logo.jpg`
   - You should see the logo image

3. **Verify HTML References**
   - The `index.html` should have: `<link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/logo.jpg" />`
   - After build, this becomes: `<link rel="icon" href="./logo.jpg" />`

4. **Force Favicon Reload**
   - Visit: `https://[your-username].github.io/[repo-name]/favicon.ico?v=2`
   - The `?v=2` parameter can force a refresh

### Different Devices

- **Desktop browsers**: Should show immediately after cache clear
- **Mobile Safari**: May take longer to update (up to 24 hours)
- **Mobile Chrome/Edge**: Usually updates within minutes

## üì± Additional Icon Sizes (Optional)

For better display across all devices, you can create multiple sizes:

1. **16x16** - Standard favicon
2. **32x32** - High DPI displays
3. **180x180** - Apple touch icon
4. **192x192** - Android home screen

Currently, the site uses the same image for all sizes, which works fine but may not be optimal for all devices.

## ‚úÖ Current Setup

Your site now has:
- ‚úÖ Favicon for browser tabs
- ‚úÖ Apple touch icon for iOS bookmarks
- ‚úÖ Updated meta description
- ‚úÖ Updated theme color to match your logo (#5DBEAA)

The logo will automatically be included every time you run `npm run deploy`!
