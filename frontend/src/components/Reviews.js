      comment: 'This by is far my favorite AIRBNB! Jonna and her family did an amazing anticipating the needs of her target audience when renovating her rental. The decor is amazing and is carried throughout the entire house. Jonna had top of the line linen, soaps, cleaners, appliances, furnishings and more. Enjoying a sunset from the back patio was the perfect way to end a day. I\'m looking forward to booking your home again in the future! Thank you for being such a wonderful Host!'

      comment: 'We absolutely loved this house! The home was exceptionally clean, the decor was stunning and the view from the back patio was so beautiful and calming. The house was equipped with everything we needed from kitchen cookware and utensils to bathroom towels, shampoo, conditioner, etc. There were even beach towels, a beach blanket, chairs and an umbrella to use which was especially beneficial since we flew in for the trip and weren\'t able to bring those things with us. The house is in a very quiet, convenient location - just minutes from the beach and airport! We would love to stay here again!'
